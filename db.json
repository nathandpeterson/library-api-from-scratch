    "author": ["Bakhtin, Mikhail", "Emerson, Caryl", "Booth, Wayne"],
    "description": "Outlines the polyphonic concept of truth. Bakhtin challenges philosophers for whom plurality of minds is accidental and superfluous. For Bakhtin, truth is not a statement, a sentence or a phrase. Instead, understanding is a number of mutually addressed, albeit contradictory and logically inconsistent, statements. Dostoevsky's corpus demonstrates the fact of mutual addressivity, of engagement, and of commitment to the context of a real-life event, that distinguishes understanding from misunderstanding.",

    "title": "Corkscrews and Courtesans: Sex and Death in Circulation Novels",
    "author": ["Blackwell, Bonnie"],
    "description": "Blackwell frames the gender politics of the it-narrative and the picaresque as a problem internal to the formulation of genre. This circular definition of the picaresque makes sexual promiscuity the self-reinforcing effect of genre, rather than its object. Female picaresque novels are about whores; therefore protagonists of female picaresque novels have loose sexual characters.",

    "title": "The Political Unconsciousness: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act",
    "author": ["Jameson, Fredric"],
    "description": "Jameson asserts the priority of the political interpretation of literary texts, claiming it to be at the center of all reading and understanding, not just a supplement or auxiliary to other methods current today.",

    "title": "Critique of Cynical Reason",
    "author": ["Sloterdijk, Peter"],
    "description": "Sloterdijk defines cynicism as 'enlightened false consciousness', a sensibility which is 'well off and miserable at the same time', able to function in the workaday world yet assailed by doubt and paralysis. Oscillating provocatively between Frankfurt and Paris and between a number of different styles and modes of expression, the Critique of Cynical Reason is a philosophical pastiche which offers, in the words of Andreas Huyssen, 'a postmodernism of resistance.'",
